        <p>
          Affectionately nicknamed &quot;the book,&quot;
          <a href="rust-book/index.html">The Rust Programming Language</a> will
          give you an overview of the language from first principles. You'll
          build a few projects along the way, and by the end, you'll have a
          solid grasp of the language.

          If reading multiple hundreds of pages about a language isn't your
          style, then
          <a href="rust-by-example/index.html">Rust By Example</a> has you
          covered. While the book talks about code with a lot of words, RBE
          shows off a bunch of code, and keeps the talking to a minimum. It also
          includes exercises!
